jiro
====

A minimalistic, light theme for iTerm, Terminal and console vim.

I built it out of frustration with how colorful and distracting other themes
tend to be. Ask any designer if he'd be willing to mix up to 16 colors in a
single design. Most would answer no, but everyone who makes terminal themes
somehow assumes they can get away with this. For this reason, Jiro makes no
distinction between "bright" and "normal" colors. For extra minimalism points,
I recommend that you disable bold fonts in your terminal.

Jiro doesn't try to be clever with the pallette choice. Magenta is replaced by
a shade of violet and cyan by teal, since those two original colors tend to
look terrible on a light background, but other than that each color is a shade
of what ANSI describes them as.

The vim theme is very restrained in its use of syntax highlighting. You get
highlighting for control structures and function/method definitions and that's
about it. Oh, and TODOs jump out at you, because they should. It only uses the
basic 8 colors (and one shade of gray for line numbers), so it's best used
together with the Terminal/iTerm theme.
